## Introduction
This work proposes a new computational framework for learning a structured generative model for real-world datasets. 
In particular, we propose a framework for closed-loop data transcription between a multi-class, high-dimensional data 
distribution and a linear discriminative representation (CTRL) in the feature space that consists of multiple independent 
multi-dimensional linear subspaces. This new framework unifies the concepts and benefits of auto-encoding (AE) and 
generative adversarial networks (GAN). It naturally extends AE and GAN concepts to the setting of learning a discriminative 
and generative representation for multi-class, high-dimensional, real-world data. Our extensive experiments on many benchmark 
image datasets demonstrate tremendous potential of this new closed-loop formulation: under fair comparison, visual quality 
of the learned decoder and classification performance of the encoder are competitive and often better than existing methods 
based on GAN, VAE, or a combination of both. We hope that this repository serves as a reproducible baseline for future 
research in this area.

The encoder *f* has dual roles: it learns an
LDR *z* for the data *x* via maximizing the rate reduction of *z* and it is also a “feedback sensor” for
any discrepancy between the data *x* and the decoded \hat{x}. The decoder *g* also has dual roles: it is a
“controller” that corrects the discrepancy between *x* and \hat{x} and it also aims to minimize the overall
coding rate for the learned LDR.

## Reproducing Results

### Installation for Reproducibility

For ease of reproducibility, we suggest you install `Miniconda` (or `Anaconda` if you prefer) before executing the following commands.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Delay-Xili/LDR
cd LDR
conda create -y -n clt
source activate clt
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
pip install git+https://github.com/kwotsin/mimicry.git
mkdir data logs
```
Note: we highly encourage you to use a version of `torch` later then `1.10.0`, since it gives a large speedup when computing `torch.logdet`.

More installation details can be found [here](https://mimicry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/introduction.html).

### Training

To retrain the neural network from scratch on your own machine, execute the following commands 
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --cfg experiments/mnist.yaml
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --cfg experiments/mnist.yaml DATA.DATASET TMNIST LOG_DIR logs/tmnist
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --cfg experiments/cifar10.yaml
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python main.py --cfg experiments/stl10.yaml DATA.ROOT pth/to/the/dataset
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2 python main.py --cfg experiments/CelebA.yaml DATA.ROOT pth/to/the/dataset
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2 python main.py --cfg experiments/LSUN.yaml DATA.ROOT pth/to/the/dataset
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2 python main.py --cfg experiments/ImageNet.yaml DATA.ROOT pth/to/the/dataset
```

Some hyper-parameters can be changed directly in the corresponding `xxx.yaml` file. 
We run the experiments on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 with 24GB memory. 
Adjust the ```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES``` parameter based on available GPUs.

Each link includes the corresponding results, which consists of three items: checkpoints, images, and data. <br>
**checkpoints**: including all saved checkpoint files of the generator and discriminator during the training.<br>
**images**: including all saved input and reconstructed images during the training.<br>
**data**: including the Tensorboard file which records the losses and learning rates of discriminator and generator during the training process.

### Evaluating the FID and IS score

To evaluate the FID and IS score of your checkpoints under ```checkpoints/```, execute 

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python evaluation.py --cfg experiments/mnist.yaml EVAL.NETD_CKPT path/to/netD/ckpt EVAL.NETG_CKPT path/to/netG/ckpt
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python evaluation.py --cfg experiments/cifar10.yaml EVAL.NETD_CKPT path/to/netD/ckpt EVAL.NETG_CKPT path/to/netG/ckpt
```

### Testing the classification accuracy

To test the accuracy of your learned discriminator, execute

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python test_acc.py --cfg experiments/mnist.yaml --ckpt_epochs 4500 EVAL.DATA_SAMPLE 1000
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python test_acc.py --cfg experiments/cifar10.yaml --ckpt_epochs 45000 EVAL.DATA_SAMPLE 1000
