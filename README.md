## Introduction
This work proposes a new computational framework for learning a structured generative model for real-world  datasets. 
In particular we propose to learn a closed-loop transcription between a multi-class multi-dimensional data distribution 
and a linear discriminative representation (LDR) in the feature space that consists of multiple  independent  multi-dimensional linear  subspaces.
This new framework unifies the concepts and benefits of Auto-Encoding and GAN and naturally extends them to the settings of 
learning a both discriminative and generative representation for  multi-class and multi-dimensional real-world data.
Our extensive experiments on many benchmark imagery datasets demonstrate tremendous potential of this new closed-loop formulation: 
under fair comparison, visual quality of the learned decoder and classification performance of the encoder is competitive 
and often better than existing methods based on GAN, VAE, or a combination of both. 
We hope that this repository serves as a reproducible baseline for future researches in this area. 

## Reproducing Results

### Installation for mimicry

For the ease of reproducibility, you are suggested to install miniconda (or anaconda if you prefer) before following executing the following commands.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Delay-Xili/LDR
cd LDR
conda create -y -n ldr
source activate ldr
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
pip install git+https://github.com/kwotsin/mimicry.git
mkdir data logs
```
Note: we highly encourage to use the version of torch later then 1.10.0 since it brings huge speed up on the calculation of the logdet.

More details of installation can be found [here](https://mimicry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/introduction.html)

### Training

To retrain the neural network from scratch on your own machine, execute the following commands 
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --cfg experiments/mnist.yaml
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --cfg experiments/cifar10.yaml
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python main.py --cfg experiments/stl10.yaml DATA.ROOT pth/to/the/dataset
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2 python main.py --cfg experiments/CelebA.yaml DATA.ROOT pth/to/the/dataset
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2 python main.py --cfg experiments/LSUN.yaml DATA.ROOT pth/to/the/dataset
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2 python main.py --cfg experiments/ImageNet.yaml DATA.ROOT pth/to/the/dataset
```

Some detail hyper-parameters can be changed directly in corresponding xxx.yaml file. 
We run the experiments on the RTX 3090 with 24GB memories. 
Adjusting the ```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES``` parameter based on your GPU memory.

Each link includes the corresponding results which consist of three files: checkpoints, images, and data. <br>
**checkpoints**: including all saved checkpoint files of G and D during the training.<br>
**images**: including all saved input and reconstructed images during the training.<br>
**data**: including the tensorboard file which recording the changes of loss D, loss G, learning rates of G and D during the training.

### Evaluating the FID and IS score

To evaluate the FID and IS score of your checkpoints under ```checkpoints/```, execute 

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python evaluation.py --cfg experiments/mnist.yaml EVAL.NETD_CKPT path/to/netD/ckpt EVAL.NETG_CKPT path/to/netG/ckpt
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python evaluation.py --cfg experiments/cifar10.yaml EVAL.NETD_CKPT path/to/netD/ckpt EVAL.NETG_CKPT path/to/netG/ckpt
```

### Testing the classification accuracy

To test the accuracy of your learned discriminator, execute

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python test_acc.py --cfg experiments/mnist.yaml --ckpt_epochs 4500 EVAL.DATA_SAMPLE 1000
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python test_acc.py --cfg experiments/cifar10.yaml --ckpt_epochs 45000 EVAL.DATA_SAMPLE 1000
```
